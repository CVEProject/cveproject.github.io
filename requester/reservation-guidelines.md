title: Researcher Reservation Guidelines
layout: page
---

This document provides information on how to reserve a CVE ID(s)
before publicizing a new vulnerability so that CVE IDs can be
included in the initial public announcement of the vulnerability and
can be used to track vulnerabilities.

Some important things to note:

* The CVE request process reduces the amount of overlap with the
  work of other entities by identifying which organization(s) should
  be contacted first.

* The CVE request process is designed to ensure all vulnerability
  information included in CVE is publicly available. This reduces
  the risk of accidental disclosure of such information. **Details
  provided in requests will not be released until those details have
  been made public.**

* If a requester does not use and share CVE IDs properly, MITRE and
  other CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) reserve the right to refuse
  assigning CVE IDs to that requester in the future. Steps 2, 10,
  11, and 12 in the list below provide details on proper use and
  sharing of CVE IDs.

* Anyone (researchers, vendors, or third-parties) can request a CVE ID
  be assigned to a vulnerability so long as they make the request
  using the proper channels.

## The basic process for reserving a CVE ID is as follows:

1.	[Determine if a CVE ID is needed and appropriate.](#1-determine-if-a-cve-id-is-needed-and-appropriate) If yes,
2.	[Contact a vendor whose product is affected to disclose a
    vulnerability (coordinated disclosure).](#2-contact-the-affected-product-vendor-directly)
3.	[Determine whether the request should be made to a vendor CNA.](#3-requests-to-a-vendor-cna) If no,
4.	[Determine whether the request should be made to a third party
    coordinator CNA, or to a disclosure mailing list.](#4-requests-to-third-party-coordinator-cnas-or-email-lists) If no,
5.	[Request a CVE ID from DWF](#5-requests-to-dwf)
6.	[Request a CVE ID from MITRE using the CVE Request web form.](#6-requests-to-mitre)
7.	[Provide the required information in the request.](#7-information-to-provide-in-the-request-to-mitre)
7.	[Receive a confirmation email with a reference number and save it for your records.](#8-confirmation-of-request)
8.	[Provide follow-up information as needed.](#9-follow-up-information-requests-from-mitre)
9.	[Receive a CVE ID (or an explanation if a CVE ID was not
    provided)](#10-receive-a-cve-id-or-rationale-if-not-assigned)
10.	[Share the CVE ID with all parties.](#11-sharing-the-cve-id-with-others)
11.	[Include the CVE ID in the announcement of the vulnerability.](#12-information-to-include-in-a-vulnerability-announcement)
12.	[Notify MITRE that the vulnerability has been made public using
    the CVE Request web form, and selecting "Notify CVE about a
	Publication."](#13-notify-the-mitre-cve-assignment-team-of-publication)

The CVE is then published by MITRE and will appear on the CVE List.

These steps are detailed in the sections below.

## 1. Determine if a CVE ID is needed and appropriate

CVE IDs are currently only assigned to vulnerabilities that are
going to be publicly announced.

1. Determine whether the problem you identified is a vulnerability.

   A vulnerability in the context of the CVE program is indicated by
   code that can be exploited, resulting in a negative impact to
   confidentiality, integrity, OR availability, and that requires a
   coding change, specification change, or specification deprecation
   to mitigate or address.

2. Ensure that the vulnerability for which you are seeking a CVE ID
   does not already have an assigned CVE ID by performing a keyword
   search on the [CVE website](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/).

## 2. Contact the affected product vendor directly

You should make a good faith effort to notify the affected vendor
and work with them to ensure that a patch is available prior to
publicly disclosing the vulnerability. Information is more accurate
and complete when researchers and vendors work together. This
practice also reduces the likelihood of a duplicate CVE ID being
issued, which can happen when both a researcher and vendor request
CVE IDs.

Without independent confirmation or vendor acknowledgement, it may
not be possible to determine if the vulnerability is real, which
could result in a request for a CVE ID being denied.

There are several documents that provide guidelines on disclosure.
See [<u>Appendix A: Documents on Disclosure Practices</u>](#appendix-a-documents-on-disclosure-practices) for more details.

In general, you should do the following:

1. Find and notify the appropriate security contact for the vendor.
   If you cannot find a contact, try technical support.

2. Allow the vendor five business days to respond and acknowledge
   that they are aware of the problem. An "auto-reply" email or
   other computer-generated response does not represent vendor
   awareness.

   a) Work with the vendor to explain the problem, conduct further
      analysis if necessary, test any patches that the vendor
	  proposes, and ensure the accuracy of both your, and the
	  vendor’s, advisory.

3. If, after five business days, the vendor is unresponsive, report
   the problem to a third party "coordinator" such as CERT/CC. These
   coordinators may have contacts with the vendor, or they may lend
   credibility to your report.

4. If an advisory will not be published by the vendor or an
   established response team (e.g., CERT/CC), you may choose to
   announce the vulnerability to a public forum that allows others
   to validate the claims. Currently, those forums include the
   Bugtraq and Full-Disclosure mailing lists, and sites such as
   exploit-db and Packet Storm.

When possible, do not announce a vulnerability until the vendor has
provided a patch. This could take between one day and six months,
depending on the vendor and the nature of the problem. If you
believe that the issue is urgent and the vendor is not responding
quickly enough, try using a coordinator as described in #4. Also,
you should avoid releasing precise details of the vulnerability
until system administrators have time to apply the patch.

## 3. Requests to a vendor CNA

Software vendors participating as [CNAs](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html) assign CVE IDs for their
products. If the vulnerability is related to a CNA product, contact
the [appropriate CNA organization](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html#participating_cnas) directly. If the request is
accepted, the organization will assign a CVE ID for the issue and
include it in its initial public announcement.

## 4. Requests to third party coordinator CNAs or email lists

If a CVE ID cannot be requested through a CNA, consider contacting a
third party coordinator such as an emergency response or
vulnerability analysis team (e.g., CERT/CC), especially when there
are problems in contacting the affected vendor. If the request is
accepted, that organization will work to have a CVE ID assigned to
the issue. Or, you may post the information to mailing lists such as
BugTraq or oss-security and, if accepted, the issue will eventually
be assigned a CVE ID by a CNA.

## 5. Requests to DWF

If you are unable to obtain a CVE ID through a third-party
coordinator and the vulnerability is in an open source product,
you can request an ID from the DWF CNA.  For public vulnerabilities
in open source software, you should use the form at https://iwantacve.org/.
For embargoed requests, you can email cve-assign@distributedweaknessfiling.org.

## 6. Requests to MITRE

If you are unable to obtain a CVE ID via the methods cited above,
you may request a CVE ID directly from MITRE using MITRE’s [CVE
Request web form](https://cveform.mitre.org/) (view [guidance](http://cve.mitre.org/about/documents.html#web_form)). Complete the "Request a CVE ID"
web form.

## 7. Information to provide in the request to MITRE

The [CVE Request web form > Request a CVE ID](https://cveform.mitre.org/) requires the following
information:

* The type of request;
* The e-mail address of the requester;
* The number of IDs being requested;
* The type of vulnerability for each CVE ID requested;
* The affected vendor for each vulnerability; and
* The affected product and version for each vulnerability (a generic
  name can be used if the vulnerability has not been made public).

The required information is the minimum information required to
request a CVE ID. However, you can also provide optional information
which can be used to provide additional detail for your CVE ID
request and may be valuable to creating the CVE entry as well as for
downstream consumers.

Optional information includes:
* Attack type;
* Impact;
* Affected component;
* Attack vector;
* Discoverer;
* References; and
* Any additional information.

## 8. Confirmation of request

Upon completion of the CVE Request web form, the requestor will
receive a confirmation email that the request was received and a
reference number. If you need to communicate with MITRE about this
request, reply to the confirmation email without changing the
subject line, as it contains the reference number associated with
your request.

If you do not seem to have received a confirmation email, please
check your spam folder.

## 9. Follow-up information requests from MITRE

If MITRE requires any additional clarification, they will contact
the requester via email, referencing the confirmation number for the
submitted CVE Request.

## 10. Receive a CVE ID (or rationale if not assigned)

Once there is enough information to confirm the vulnerability exists
and that it affects a covered product, the MITRE CVE Assignment Team
will reply to the requester with a CVE ID. The CVE ID is considered
"reserved" at this stage. Descriptions with details of the
vulnerability will only be added when the vulnerability is made
public (see step 12).

If the vulnerability is not confirmed, or if it is not in a covered
product, a CVE ID request may be rejected. In this case, the
requester will receive a response from the MITRE CVE Assignment Team
notifying them of the decision.

## 11. Sharing the CVE ID with others

Once a CVE ID is obtained, provide it to all affected vendors and
other parties (such as CERT/CC) with whom you are communicating.
This makes it easier to share information about the vulnerability
and reduces the risk that different parties may assign different CVE
IDs to the same vulnerability.

## 12. Information to include in a vulnerability announcement

When publishing a vulnerability with an associated CVE ID, include
the CVE ID in the announcement. Announcements containing multiple
CVE IDs should delineate which CVE ID is associated with which
vulnerability.

The following information may be contained in the vulnerability
announcement:

* The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
  assigned the ID CVE-YYYY-NNNN to this issue. This is an entry on
  [the CVE List](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/index.html), which standardizes names for security problems.
* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-YYYY-NNNN
* CVE ID: CVE- YYYY-NNNN

Some tips:

1. When announcing more than one CVE ID, associate each CVE ID with
   the vulnerability it is assigned to, so that people can easily
   identify which CVE ID is related to each issue. For example:

   CVE-yyyy-nnnn - buffer overflow in product

   CVE-yyyy-mmmm - format string

2. OSVDB offers additional suggestions about other content in the
   announcement:

   [https://blog.osvdb.org/2013/01/15/researcher-security-advisory-writing-guidelines](https://blog.osvdb.org/2013/01/15/researcher-security-advisory-writing-guidelines)

## 13. Notify the MITRE CVE Assignment Team of publication

After your announcement has been publicized, contact the MITRE CVE
Assignment Team via the [CVE Request web form](https://cveform.mitre.org/). 
Select "Notify CVE about a publication" and provide the following
information:

* The CVE ID(s) assigned to the vulnerabilities being publicly
  announced
* Links to the public forum(s) or advisories where the announcements
  can be found
* (Optional) A description for each vulnerability to be used in
  the official CVE List.

Until this information is provided to MITRE, only a reserved CVE
entry may be recorded on the CVE web site. No description or details
of the vulnerability will be made available in the CVE entry until
the vulnerability has been publicized.

When notified of a publication, MITRE will then populate the CVE
entry with a description and references. This information will be
made available on the [CVE List](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/index.html).

The CVE information will also be updated in [the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

## Appendix B: Determining if CVE IDs are needed

There are several factors to consider to determine whether one or
more vulnerabilities require a CVE ID when providing information to
MITRE:

A. Duplicates. Duplicates may be found by searching the MITRE CVE
site and also by general web searches. Also, if a researcher
previously contacted another organization on the CNA list about a
vulnerability, a CVE ID assignment may already exist. The
vulnerability should not be duplicated by the assignment of two CVE
IDs.

B. Origination. CVE IDs are assigned to issues for which the primary
method of addressing the vulnerability is for the vendor to take an
action to remediate the vulnerability in their product. CVE IDs are
not for cases in which the primary method of addressing the
vulnerability is for an action to be taken by the operator of a
single website or online service.

C. Establishing a policy violation. CVE IDs are needed when the
vendor agrees that the observed product behavior violates a security
policy, such as an unintended loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
availability. CVE IDs are not for cases in which a reporter
unilaterally believes that product hardening is desirable, such as a
different approach to abuse prevention, or a different display of
security-relevant data.

D. Establishing whether the vulnerabilities differ. In cases of
multiple findings reported at the same time for a single product,
separate CVE IDs are sometimes needed when there is a difference in
the primary vulnerability types or affected versions.

E. Cross-vendor coordination. Separate CVE IDs are not assigned
solely because vulnerable code is shipped in more than one product.
Particularly in the case of open-source software, it is common for
multiple vendors to use the same CVE ID in any scenario in which
they have bundled, repackaged, or copied a piece of vulnerable code.
