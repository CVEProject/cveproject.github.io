title: "CVE Content Decisions: Application Guidance for CNAs"
layout: page
---

Last Modified: November 20, 2014<br>


<p>

This document provides guidance to CVE Candidate Numbering Authorities
(CNAs) to help them determine how many CVE identifiers to assign to a
set of issues.

</p><p>

This guidance only applies to CVE assignment that occurs <u>BEFORE
DISCLOSURE.</u> MITRE must be consulted after disclosure, and has
additional rules that may be followed.

</p><p>

</p><h1>
<font color="FF0000">CVE Assignment Might Be Different Than You
Expect</font>
</h1>


Following this guidance is essential.  It might not recommend what you
expect.  People count vulnerabilities differently, which can lead to
different methods for how to assign CVE identifiers.  However, because
there are multiple CNAs, it is important to follow these guidelines in
order to guarantee consistency between the CNAs.

<p>

This guidance is mostly based on well-established CVE rules called
"content decisions."  These help CVE to be consistent, even when the
amount of details can vary widely across different disclosures, or
when knowledge changes across time within a single disclosure.  These
have emerged over years, but they have proven to be repeatable - if
followed properly.

</p><h1>ABSTRACTION Decision Tree</h1>


<p>

Use this decision tree to determine how many different CVE identifiers
should be assigned to a set of issues.  You must address ALL items in
the decision tree before making a final decision.


</p><p>

Consider two issues - whether distinct bugs or attack vectors.  Assume
they satisfy the INCLUSION decision tree.  Call them X and Y.

</p><p>

The possible conclusions for this decision tree are:

</p><ul>

<li><font color="FF0000"><b>SPLIT</b></font> - assign separate CVE identifiers
to X and Y

</li><li><font color="FF0000"><b>MERGE</b></font> - assign the same CVE identifier
to both X and Y (i.e. combine them)

</li><li><font color="FF0000"><b>CONSULT</b></font> - DO NOT assign a CVE
identifier; instead, consult MITRE (issue is complex)

</li></ul>

<h3>Example Table</h3>

For example, suppose you have issues V1, V2, V3, V4, and V5, which
have different affected versions and bug types.  Your table might look
something like:

<p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th>Bug type</th><th>Version</th><th>Issues</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>XSS</td><td>1.0</td><td>V1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>XSS</td><td>1.0 and 2.0</td><td>V2, V3, V4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SQL injection</td><td>2.0</td><td>V5</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</p>

<p>
	One multi-issue group remains: V2/V3/V4.  Apply the ABSTRACTION CDs to
	that group.
</p>

<p>
	V1 and V5 would be split from this group.

<h1>Complex Abstraction Scenarios</h1>


<h2>Vulnerability and Attack Chains</h2>

<p></p>

<ul>
	<li>When dealing with multiple issues that are chained together, a
	general rule to use is: "if one issue is fixed, then does it
	automatically fix the second issue?"  If so, then the first issue is
	probably the "root cause," and only one CVE would be needed.  But if
	the second issue could still exist even after the first is fixed,
	then likely both of them need separate issues.
	</li>

	<li>If bug X creates a condition that introduces bug Y - e.g., an
	integer overflow that leads to a buffer overflow - then you need to
	consider whether X, on its own, would be a vulnerability.  In the
	case of an integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow, the
	integer overflow would not be a problem on its own; it is simply an
	incorrect calculation.
	</li>

	<li>Consider issues X and Y.  Suppose the attacker can exploit X in
	order to gain privilege P.  Then, using P, the attacker can exploit
	Y.  In this case, the primary question is whether a valid user with
	privilege P already has the capability to perform Y.  For example,
	consider a web application in which any remote, unauthenticated
	attacker can call an administrator function that modifies web pages;
	the attacker then modifies the web page to insert an HTML injection
	(XSS) attack.  Here, an administrator is already allowed to modify
	HTML; the admin is already have the legitimate privileges to insert
	arbitrary HTML or Javascript code into the page, so to an admin
	there is no extra benefit to attempting an XSS.  As a result, only
	one CVE would be assigned - to the web application's lack of access
	control to the admin function - and the XSS would be "resultant"
	from that.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Variants, Incomplete Fixes, and Regression Errors</h2>

<p>
	<b>Variants.</b>  Generally, if an issue X is
	fixed in one software version, but a new variant, Y, is discovered
	that affects the new version, these are typically SPLIT.  The reason
	is that X and Y affect different versions.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Regression Errors.</b>  Regression errors are
	generally SPLIT.  For the purpose of CVE, a specific issue is called a
	regression error when:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> the issue appears in a version (e.g., 3.1).
	</li><li> the issue is fixed in a subsequent version (e.g., 3.2).
	</li><li> a CVE ID is assigned for this issue.
	</li><li> at a later time, the exact same issue re-appears in a later version
	(e.g., 3.4).
	</li>
</ul>

In this case, a separate CVE ID would then be assigned.

<p>
	The rationale is that since there was a fixed version between 3.1 and
	3.4, CVE consumers and CVE-compatible tools have likely associated the
	CVE with only version 3.1, applied patches that are only associated
	with version 3.1, etc.  So, the assignment of a separate CVE ID for
	the issue in version 3.4 acts as a "signal" that there is a different
	issue that requires a distinct action.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Later identification of additional affected versions.</b>  When an
	issue is published with one set of versions, and later it is reported
	that other versions are also affected, this typically will result in a
	MERGE (with a CVE description update), except for regression errors as
	outlined previously.
</p>

<p>
	Here are a few common scenarios in which additional versions might be
	announced at a later time:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>if the vendor is maintaining multiple ranges of versions
	simultaneously, such as a legacy major version 2.x that is still
	being actively maintained and a modern major version 3.x, the vendor
	might announce the vulnerability before all version ranges have been
	patched.  Other affected major versions might have their fixes
	published days, weeks, or months later.  This is not considered a
	regression error, but instead, a clarification of the set of
	affected versions for the original bug; as long as the same bug is
	being patched, a new CVE would not need to be assigned for these
	additional versions.
	</li>

	<li>A researcher who does not coordinate closely with a vendor might
	publicize a vulnerability with incomplete version information,
	e.g. if they were analyzing an older version of the software.
	Later, the vendor (or another researcher) might publish that other,
	later versions are also affected.  Typically, no new CVE would be
	necessary, as long as there are not any apparent fixes in between
	the original version and the more recently-announced version (which
	would suggest a regression error); ideally, the CVE description
	would be updated with the new version information.
	</li>
</ul>



<h1>Common Assumptions That Frequently Lead to Assignment Errors</h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>One remote, one local.</b> I have two buffer overflows in the
	same product.  One is exploitable <u>remotely</u>, and one is
	exploitable <u>locally</u>.  Should I SPLIT them?
		<ul>
			<li>No (rather, these would stay merged based only on these two
				criteria).  ADT1 would not split - it's the same product.  ADT2
				would not split - it's the same bug type.  ADT3 woud not split -
				it's the same affected version.  However ADT4, explicitly says
				that the two issues should stay MERGED even if they have a
				different "access vector."
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Different bugs in different executables.</b>  I have two bugs
	of the same type in an open source product, such as SQL injection.
	There are two separate patches, in parameter X in executable A,
	and in parameter Y in executable B.  These are <u>clearly
	different bugs</u>.  Should I SPLIT them?
		<ul>
			<li>No.  They are in the same product, so ADT1 would not split.
				They are the same bug type, SQL injection, so ADT2 would not
				split.  They affect the same version, so ADT3 would not split.
				Also, ADT4 explicitly says that the issues should stay merged when
				"X appears in a different DLL, library, program, or application
				than Y."
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Different Impacts.</b>  I have two bugs, both directory
	traversal, affecting the same product versions.  One allows me to
	delete files, and the other allows me to read files.  Should I SPLIT
	them?
		<ul>
			<li>No.  By ADT1, there is no split since the bugs are in the same
				product.  There also is no split for the same bug type (ADT2) and
				affected versions (ADT3).  Finally, ADT4 explicitly recommends
				merge when "X has a more serious impact than Y."
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<p></p>

<h3>Changing CVEs Assignments After Discovering New Information</h3>


<ul>

<li> I assigned a CVE, but later analysis showed that the issue is not
a vulnerability.  The initial bug report was never publicly disclosed.
Can I re-assign the CVE to another issue?

  <ul><li>Probably not, especially if you have shared the CVE ID with
  any other external party.  Consult MITRE.
  </li></ul>

</li><li> I MERGED several issues into a single CVE, but after disclosure,
it became clear that these should have been SPLIT.  What should be
done about this?

  <ul><li>Work with MITRE on determining whether a SPLIT should be
  performed; if so, MITRE will do so.
  </li></ul>

</li><li> I've learned about a duplicate CVE.  What should I do?  Which CVE
should I use?

  <ul><li>Consult MITRE; only MITRE, as the Primary CNA, can decide
  which ID to use when a duplicate occurs.  (We generally follow the
  process as documented in
  https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/duplicates.html).
  </li></ul>

</li></ul>

<p>

</p><h3>Limited Disclosure Policy</h3>

<p>

</p><ul>

<li>I have a disclosure policy where I don't release
specific details about vulnerabilities, such as the type of
vulnerability.  How do I assign CVEs?

</li><li>I have a disclosure policy where I don't focus on issues
when I don't think they're important enough for my customers.  Do I
have to assign a CVE to those issues?



</li></ul>



<a name="checklist"></a>
<h1>Final Pre-Disclosure Checklist for CVE</h1>


Shortly before disclosure, follow this checklist for each CVE:

<p>

<table border="5" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="E0E0E0"><b>Share the CVE:</b>
</td><td>

Make sure that you've shared the CVE with all parties who are involved
in the disclosure.  This reduces the chance of duplicates.

</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="E0E0E0"><b>Avoid typos:</b>
</td><td>

Make sure that none of your CVE numbers contain typos.  One way to do
this is to ensure that the CVE web site lists the "RESERVED" string in
each of their descriptions.

</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="E0E0E0"><b>Multiple CVEs assigned:</b>
</td><td>

Ensure that your advisory clearly indicates which CVEs are associated
with which issues.

</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="E0E0E0"><b>New issues discovered:</b>
</td><td>

If new issues were found during the disclosure process, see if you
need to SPLIT or MERGE them with the CVEs you already assigned.

</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="E0E0E0"><b>Early disclosure:</b>
</td><td>

If the issue has already been publicly disclosed, even in a vague way,
check with MITRE.  Search the CVE or NVD web sites to be sure.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
