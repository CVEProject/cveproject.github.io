Revision Process (also to be added to the CNA Rules as an Appendix):

Revisions will be made in Git.

Revision list document and DRAFT new version.

Create a template for submissions to the CNA Rules revision process.

Suggested Rules Changes

These are suggested changes to the CNA Rules. These changes have not been vetted, and they may not have been fully developed or discussed. As suggestions are developed and discussed by the Board and the CNA community, this list will be updated to indicate if each suggestion will be incorporated or declined.

Comments can be added to each item or included in the Git comment system.

______

GOAL: Better define the correct use of CVE.
CHANGE: Should the requirement that CVE assignments must be public or planned to be made public be removed?
  - Should there be a new record type: "Not Public". This would accommodate the use case of a CVE ID being assigned without there being an intention for it to ever be made public (outside of the CNA's internal operation).
OUTCOME: CVE will be used as widely as necessary for as many use cases as practical.

GOAL: Track who reserved what CVE IDs.
CHANGE: Should the original reservation entity or reservation chain be added to required data?
OUTCOME: Regardless of the assigner, the entire Sub CNA/Root CNA chain of CVE ID reservations will be included in each CVE entry.

GOAL: Streamline the CVE Entry creation process.
CHANGE: Should "Description" be excluded from the required fields in Appendix B?
OUTCOME: CNAs and requesters will be able to assign CVE IDs with the least necessary effort.


GOAL: Make CNA scope more easily determined by third parties.
CHANGE: Add a rule that states a CNA must provide a page on their web site which lists the products for which they accept vulnerability reports. This includes a listing of EOL (or other) software that are explicitly _not_ covered.
OUTCOME: CNA scopes will be easy to find by anyone.


GOAL: Clarify existing language.
	- Page 5 of the current CNA rules state:
"In cases where requests or issues cannot be resolved by a given CNA, the issues are escalated to the next higher level CNA."
Provide examples of the kinds of issues that might cause escalations. Also, create rule that requires some kind of paper trail for attempts to work with the CNA.
	-Clarification around disclosure policies and what kinds of vulnerabilities (public, non-public, etc.) are given CVE IDs by the CNA and for what specific scope. Include a policy template. (Review the Embargo and Disclosure template)
	- Clarify the difference between "when a vulnerability is made public" versus "when a vulnerability is added to the CVE list" and how they affect each other.
	- Better describe the nested Root CNA structure (with a new diagram?).
OUTCOME: Less vague or confusing language.

GOAL:
CHANGE: Should we also allow projects/etc. to simply embed the data into their CNA listing, especially if it is "simple" (e.g. an Open Source project with a single software project, or a project with multiple projects that are well defined (e.g. within their GitHub organization) where they cover "everything" for example
OUTCOME:

GOAL:
CHANGE: Ensure some normalized format for the data, e.g. JSON? a simple list?
OUTCOME:

GOAL:
CHANGE: Ensure discoverability of the CNA coverage page (e.g. they list the URL in their CNA entry?)
OUTCOME:

GOAL:
CHANGE: Tie JSON updates schedule to CNA Rules update schedule.
OUTCOME:

GOAL:
CHANGE: Should we make the publication date a required field? 
OUTCOME:

GOAL: Simplify assignment process
CHANGE: Just make CVE ID year the year it was assigned.
OUTCOME: Reduced overhead for getting a CVE ID with the correct year.  Reduced confusion by CVE consumers.

GOAL:  Make the CNA processes more standardized and repeatable.
CHANGE: Define when an entry be marked as disputed versus rejected.
OUTCOME:  Consistent results with defensible reasoning

GOAL: Transparency
CHANGE: The CVE List cannot be the first point of publication for any information.
OUTCOME:  Document current policy

GOAL:  Make the CNA processes more standardized and repeatable.
CHANGE Define how to handle third-party updates to a CNA's entry. References? Description changes?
OUTCOME: Set expectations, consistent results, and transparent processes.

GOAL:  Increase coverage
CHANGE:  Expand who can be a CNA (from CERTs, vendors, CCs).
OUTCOME:  Clarify requirements for becoming a CNA.  

GOAL:  Make the CNA processes more standardized and repeatable.
CHANGE:  Describe the annual review cycle for rejecting CVE IDs.
OUTCOME:  

GOAL:  
CHANGE:  Appendix B overhaul including what needs to be in the Description (product/version).
OUTCOME:

GOAL:  Make the CNA processes more standardized and repeatable.
CHANGE:  Define if and how CNAs assign CVE IDs to bundled third-party products.
OUTCOME:  Reduce duplicate, increased transparency in processes, and better quality entries.
WORDING:
	A product vendor may assign a CVE ID to a bundled product, if
		the producer of the bundled product is not a CNA
		they coordinate with the producer of the bundled product or 
    (if contact with the producer fails) the Root CNA for the product.

GOAL:  Make the CNA Rules easier to use
CHANGE: Split CNT3 into a rule for codebases and another for standards, libraries, etc.
OUTCOME:  Increased clarity in the process.
WORDING:
	CNT3: Shared Codebase
		Affects a single product, assign one CVE ID
		Affects the same code in multiple products, assign a CVE ID to each affected codebase
		Affects multiple products but with different code, assign a CVE ID to each product
		Not sure or undefined, assign a CVE ID to each product
	CNT 4: Libraries, Protocols, Standards, etc.
		Results from conforming to the specification, assign a single CVE ID.
		Results from a choice by the implementer, assign a CVE ID to each affected codebase.
		Not sure, assign a CVE ID to each affected codebase.
 
GOAL:  Make the CNA Rules easier to use
CHANGE: Add extra decision for the case when issues aren't independently fixable and when you aren't sure.
OUTCOME:  
WORDING:
	CNT1:
		If a vulnerability can be fixed independently of the others, go to CNT2.
		If the vulnerabilities cannot be fixed independently, group the bugs together and go to CNT2.
		If it is not clear whether the vulnerabilities can be fixed independently, group the bugs together and go to CNT2.

GOAL: Document existing policy
CHANGE: INC2 should be changed to clarify that the vulnerabilities that are already public can be assigned a CVE ID.
OUTCOME:  Reduced confusion.

GOAL: Increase adobption of CVE
CHANGE: Remove CVE ID assignment requirements for Root CNAs
OUTCOME:  Organizations willing to be a Root CNA but without the resources to handle CVE ID assignment will become join.

GOAL:  Clarify the CNA Rules
CHANGE: Rework the wording for INC4
OUTCOME:  The Counting Rules are easier to implement.

GOAL:  Incentivise proper behavior
CHANGE:  Change the issue resolution processes (Appendix E) to account for CNAs who violate the rules
OUTCOME:  Fewer rules violations

GOAL: Fix typos.
CHANGE:
	- 2.2.9 has a typo at the end.
OUTCOME: Correct grammar and spelling.

GOAL: Better define terms.
CHANGE: 
	- Better define "hardware" with regard to CVE.
	- Go through the CNA docs and highlight some of the potentially undefined/problematic terms/phrases, e.g. "public disclosure" and so on is so that we can maybe define them better. 
OUTCOME: Regularized terminology.

GOAL: Improve process descriptions.
CHANGE:
	- Add references and rules updates regarding the CVE JSON format and its use.
	- The current CNA rules do not stipulate a specific time by which a CNA should update their upstream CNA after a CVE ID has been made public. MITRE asked the Board for guidance on the most time a CNA can wait. The Board suggested that CNAs should update their upstream CNAs within 24 hours of the publication of a CVE ID. This recommendation will be added to the list of updates to be considered for the next CNA Rules update.
	- Additionally, CVE IDs that have been reserved for long periods of time without any public assignment could be “REJECT”ed or labeled in some other way to indicate they are inactive in the CVE list.
	- Include rules describing how and when to assign CVE IDs using a year different from the current one.
http://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#year_portion_of_cve_id
	- Add explicit how-to steps for submitting CVE entries to the Primary CNA.
	- Include rules explicitly describing when and how unused CVE IDs will be rejected each year.
	- How to assign for bundled third-party products.
OUTCOME: CNAs will have clear processes to follow.

GOAL: Better data in CVE database - IMPACT data
CHANGE: Make IMPACT an explicitly required component of the CVE unless it is truly not known. Ideally the information should be specific (e.g. "code execution") but if not a more general (AIC impact) should be provided.
OUTCOME: Less "unknown impact CVEs"
