  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE&reg;) is a dictionary of common
  names (i.e., CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security
  vulnerabilities. CVE's common identifiers enable data exchange between
  security products and provide a baseline index point for evaluating coverage
  of tools and services.
