title: CVE Automation Transition Details
layout: page
---
Two major CVE Automation deployments are planned for calendar 2022 that will significantly enhance the [CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/)’s ongoing transition towards a fully automated [CVE ID](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEID) assignment and [CVE Record](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryRecord) publishing/updating environment for the [CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/CNAs) community. 

The purpose of this webpage is to inform and help prepare CNAs for the upcoming releases of:

* <strong>[CVE Services v2.1](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services)</strong> &mdash; CVE Services is a CVE Program Web Application that allows members of the CNA community to reserve [CVE IDs](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryCVEID) and publish/update/reject [CVE Records](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryRecord) 24/7. It is meant to fully automate the CVE Record publication process that is used today that often involves significant manual intervention and maintenance. CVE Services 2.1 is a major upgrade that includes the adoption of CVE JSON 5.0 (see below). With the deployment of CVE Services 2.1, CNAs will be able to perform the most common CVE Program functions in a more efficient manner, obtaining results in the matter of minutes. 
* <strong>[CVE JSON v5.0](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/blob/master/schema/v5.0/CVE_JSON_5.0_schema.json)</strong> &mdash; JSON is the format used by CNAs for publishing CVE Records. CVE JSON 5.0, which is a major upgrade to JSON 4.0 that further normalizes and enriches how CVE information is presented, adds several new data fields to CVE Records. In addition to the required data of CVE ID number, affected product(s), affected version(s), and public references, JSON 5.0 CVE Records will now include optional data such as severity scores, credit for researchers, additional languages, affected product lists, additional references, ability for community contributions, etc. This optional data will enhance CVE Records for both downstream users and the overall vulnerability management community. 

[Transition Details Bulletins](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-transition#transition-details), and links to [additional helpful resources](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-transition#additional-resources) are included below. Future transition schedule and bulletin updates will be posted below.

## Transition Details

## Bulletin Number 7
<strong>*Call for Community Penetration Testing Volunteers to Test CVE Services 2.1 —  June 23, 2022*</strong>

The CVE Program is preparing for the deployment of the [CVE Record Submission and Upload Service (RSUS)](/automation-cve-services#services-overview), and an updated data format (i.e., [CVE JSON 5.0](/automation-cve-services#json-overview)).

The program thanks those of you who participated in previous milestones (e.g., early adoption of the CVE ID Reservation, CVE Services Requirements collection, CVE Services code development and review, Penetration Testing and Security analysis) as we move forward with development, testing, and deployment.

#### <strong>A request for continued support: CVE Services 2.1 Penetration Testing II, July 18-July 29</strong>

We performed Penetration Testing on [CVE Services 2.1](/automation-cve-services#services-overview) in March 2022, during which we identified issues that must be addressed prior to RSUS and JSON 5.0 deployment.

Beginning July 18 (and running through July 29) we will be engaging in another round of community penetration testing to achieve a level of assurance necessary to deploy. The program needs your help! The community is an integral part of building assurance and previously made substantial contributions from a testing perspective. If you have interest, contact the AWG Chair Kris Britton and he will get you the information you need to get started.

#### <strong>If you cannot participate in the Penetration Testing II event, you can still get familiar with CVE Services 2.1</strong>

CVE Services 2.1 will be a major upgrade to CVE Services 1.1.1 as it will provide the API for “client applications” to not only reserve CVE IDs in “near real time” and manage your own “user base” but it will also support the automated submission and update of CVE Records. When it is deployed, CNAs will be able “Post” records immediately to the CVE List with the records being available to the public in near real-time. 

Contact the AWG Chair if you have interest in either of the following:

* Using the “CVE Services Testing Instance” to test your client for CVE Services 2.1
* Joining the [CVE Automation Working Group (AWG)](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups) which meets every Tuesday to discuss requirements, status, and all things related to CVE Services 

Please check this page regularly for updates. You may also [contact us](https://cveform.mitre.org/) with any comments or concerns.

## Bulletin Number 6
<strong>*Submitting CVE Records after CVE Service 2.x/JSON 5.0 Roll-out —  May 20, 2022*</strong>

As we prepare for CVE Services 2.x/JSON 5.0 roll-out in the coming weeks, there have been a number of questions about the various methods CNAs currently use to make CVE ID reservations and publish CVE Records and which methods will continue to be supported post deployment.

This bulletin clarifies the CVE Program specific methods that will be available to CNAs for reserving CVE IDs and submitting CVE Records after CVE Services/JSON 5.0 deployment. For non-CNAs, the existing method for requesting CVE IDs will not be affected.

<h3>Non-CNA Submission Methods</h3>

Non-CNAs will continue to contact the appropriate CNA to request CVE IDs, as described on the [Report/Request](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/ReportRequest) page on the CVE Program website. The CNA that assigns the ID will publish the CVE Record.

In addition, the CVE Program Secretariat will continue to maintain the [CVE Program Request web form](https://cveform.mitre.org/) for non-CNAs to submit vulnerability reports.

<h3>CNA Submission Methods</h3>
For CNAs, there will be five methods to reserve CVE IDs and submit CVE Records. Some methods will be retired over time while others will have constraints, but all five methods described below will be available for use immediately after CVE Services 2.x/JSON 5.0 is deployed.

CNAs that don’t yet have a CVE Services account may contact their Root to receive account credentials ahead of deployment.

<br/>

<h4><i>Method 1: The current CVE Program Secretariat Web Forms</i></h4>

This method allows CNAs to submit CVE Records in multiple formats: JSON 4.0, CSV, and flat file.
For a limited time, CNAs will continue to be able to request CVE ID Reservations and publish CVE Records as they do today using the CVE Program Secretariat [CVE Program Request web forms](https://cveform.mitre.org/). All currently supported input formats will continue to be supported, but this method will not process JSON 5.0 formatted input.

<hr style="border:1px solid red">

<h3>This submission method will be retired 90 days after CVE Services/JSON 5.0 is deployed.</h3>

<hr style="border:1px solid red">

<br/>

<h4><i>Method 2: CVE List GitHub Submission Pilot</i></h4>

This method allows CNAs to submit CVE Records in JSON 4.0 using GitHub pull requests. 
For a limited time, CNAs will continue to be able to use the [CVE List GitHub Submission Pilot](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist) to submit CVE Records in JSON 4.0, which will then be upconverted to JSON 5.0 records. 

<hr style="border:1px solid red">

<h3>This submission method will be retired 90 days after CVE Services/JSON 5.0 is deployed.</h3>

<hr style="border:1px solid red">

<br/>

<h4><i>Method 3: Vulnogram</i></h4>

This method is an existing web-based tool for reserving CVE IDs and creating and submitting CVE Records that is currently in use by CNAs. JSON 4.0 will continue to be supported in this method for 90 days post deployment.

After CVE Services/JSON 5.0 is deployed, this method will only accept direct user input (i.e., no attached files) and will submit JSON 5.0 CVE Records directly to CVE Services on the CNA’s behalf for publication on the CVE List. 

To use this method, CNAs will need to present their CVE Services User ID and authentication token through [Vulnogram](https://vulnogram.github.io/cve5/#editor) to identify/authenticate to CVE Services. New users, please request CVE Services credentials from your Root. 

<hr style="border:1px solid black">

<h3>Active submission method.</h3>

<hr style="border:1px solid black">

<br/>

<h4><i>Method 4: Adopt an available CVE Services Client</i></h4>

CVE Services is implemented as a Client/Server architecture. This method enables CNAs to adopt an already existing client and install and execute it in their own environment to assign CVE IDs and create and submit CVE Records. 

Three clients are currently available for use as part of CVE Services/JSON 5.0 deployment:

 * [Vulnogram web-based interface](https://vulnogram.github.io/cve5/#editor) (described above as Method 3)
 * [Red Hat command line interface – cvelib](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/cvelib)
 * [CERT/CC simple HTML interface – cveClient](https://github.com/CERTCC/cveClient)

<hr style="border:1px solid black">

<h3>Active submission method.</h3>

<hr style="border:1px solid black">

<br/>

<h4><i>Method 5: CNAs can develop their own clients</i></h4>

CNAs may develop their own CVE Services clients. The CVE Program is currently preparing documentation to support that development, which will be announced in a future bulletin.

## Bulletin Number 5
<strong>*JSON 5.0 Format Record Review —  March 23, 2022*</strong>

The CVE Program transition to CVE JSON 5.0 continues with the community review of historical JSON 4.0 records that have been converted to JSON 5.0 format.

The message below, sent to CNAs by the Quality Working Group (QWG) on March 21, 2022, announces that review:

CNAs,

The GitHub submission pilot has been using an experimental JSON format (version 4.0) for publishing CVE Records. The CVE Quality Working Group has been working to improve this format for use with the upcoming [CVE Services API](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services), with a better-specified schema while fulfilling new requirements from the CVE Program ([version 5.0](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema)).

As part of this process, all existing CVE Records (about 181 thousand) are being programmatically upconverted and are available at [https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/master/review_set](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/master/review_set) (last updated March 15th).

An index of these records by the CNAs is available here [https://cveproject.github.io/quality-workgroup/reports/](https://cveproject.github.io/quality-workgroup/reports/). You can also compare the records and their display previews for any converted CVE ID using the tool [https://vulnogram.github.io/seaview/](https://vulnogram.github.io/seaview/).

During this process, 314 records had issues with the data and are autocorrected to ensure we have valid content in the CVE Records. Such corrections include trimming excessively long fields and dropping invalid dates and data. Such records are reported here: [https://cveproject.github.io/quality-workgroup/reports/warnings]( https://cveproject.github.io/quality-workgroup/reports/warnings).

 <ol>
   <li>
     Please review <a href="https://cveproject.github.io/quality-workgroup/reports/">your CVE Records</a> to ensure the <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/tree/master/schema/v5.0/support/CVE_4_to_5_converter">upconversion script</a> did not alter the meaning of the CVE Records.
    <br><br>
    If you believe <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/tree/master/schema/v5.0/support/CVE_4_to_5_converter">the upconversion script</a> has a bug, please raise an issue at <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues">https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues</a> or suggest changes to the <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/tree/master/schema/v5.0/support/CVE_4_to_5_converter">upconverter script</a> using a pull request. The upconverter will be used to continually transform any JSON 4.0 submissions to JSON 5.0 format for use in the CVE Services API during the transition phase while CNAs migrate to CVE JSON 5.0.
    <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
    Please <a href="https://cveproject.github.io/quality-workgroup/reports/warnings">review this warnings report</a> to check if you have any CVE Records that triggered warnings or errors.
   <br><br>
   If you have a CVE Record that needs to be fixed, you have a few options:
   <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>(Preferred) wait for the record submission feature in the CVE Services to be available (ETA June 2022)</li>
        <li>Submit corrections to the records via the Git pilot submission process</li>
        <li>No action is needed if the autocorrects make sense to you</li>
      </ul>
   <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    The display/layout of the CVE Record information as shown on <a href="https://vulnogram.github.io/seaview/">vulnogram.github.io/seaview</a> would be similar to how these records may be rendered on the new <a href="https://www.cve.org/">cve.org website</a>. Feedback on this new CVE Record display or layout is most welcome.
  </li>
 </ol>

If you have any further questions, please feel free to raise them with the CVE Quality Working Group ([cve-board-qualitywg-list@mitre.org](mailto:cve-board-qualitywg-list@mitre.org)) or as issues at [https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues).

## Bulletin Number 4
<strong>*CVE Services Transition  —  March 21, 2022*</strong>

This message is to inform you about a revision to the CVE Services deployment schedule that will affect when CVE Services 2.1 is available for use by CNAs.

[CVE Services 2.1](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-cve-services#services-overview) consists of the Record Submission and Upload Service (RSUS) and the new [CVE JSON 5.0](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-cve-services#json-overview) data format. The CVE Program is in the middle of testing CVE Services 2.1. The program thanks the CVE community for participating in the functional and penetration testing during the test period that began on February 25, 2022. 

As a result of the ongoing testing, multiple issues have been identified. The [CVE Automation Working Group (AWG)](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups#AutomationWorkingGroupAWG) is currently developing the sprint plans and deployment schedule to remediate the identified issues as quickly as possible. Once developed, the AWG will manage the sprints to fix the identified issues. Then, a second period of testing will be opened to the community. The second testing period is the best way to ensure that the services are effective and secure.

Once these sprints and schedule are better defined, they will be published to enhance community understanding of the issues and foster voluntary participation in the CVE Program (e.g., the AWG). Information related to the sprints and deployment plan will be announced on the [CVE CNA Slack channel](https://cve-cna.slack.com/), [CVE CNA Discussion email list](mailto:cve-cna-list@mitre.org), this [CVE Program Automation Website](/), and on CVE social media. 

To ensure the CVE Program delivers effective, automated, and secure CVE 2.1 services that reduce the transaction costs of program participation, the “CVE Global Summit” is being shifted to a later date so that program participants can get an interactive, “hands on” description of the services to make the transition to the services easier. A new summit date will be announced in the near future.

Please check this page regularly for updates. You may also [contact us](https://cveform.mitre.org/) with any comments or concerns.

## Bulletin Number 3
<strong>*CVE Services Transition  —  March 16, 2022*</strong>

The activities and schedule for the transition to CVE Services 2.1 and CVE JSON 5.0, as provided last month in [Transition Bulletin #2](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-transition#bulletin-number-2), are now underway. This bulletin adds two new activities and schedule updates. Most importantly, it adds an important new notification to CNAs that the [CVE List GitHub Submission Pilot](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist) will be retired as part of the transition (see below for details).

<strong>Transition Schedule and Activity Updates</strong>

Detailed descriptions for activities 1-6 below are provided in [Transition Bulletin #2](https://cveproject.github.io/automation-transition#bulletin-number-2). This new bulletin, Transition Bulletin #3, includes the addition of two new activities and updates to the transition schedule, to ensure CNAs have advance notice of all upcoming transition activities and actions needed by CNAs.  

Detailed descriptions of the two newly added activities for Bulletin #3 are included below. They have also been added as items 7 and 8 in the transition schedule that follows.

* <strong>CVE List GitHub Submission Pilot Retirement</strong> &mdash; The CVE List GitHub Submission Pilot is JSON 4.0-based and will not be upgraded to JSON 5.0. As a JSON 4.0 based effort, it will not continue to operate after JSON 4.0 Retirement. It will continue to operate for 3 months after CVE Services 2.1/JSON 5.0 Hard Deployment. After JSON 4.0 Retirement, JSON 5.0 format will be the only format that is available for download (other downloadable formats will be retired), and CNAs will be expected to submit CVE Records in JSON 5.0 format through either CVE Services web application API, or a program designated web interface.

* <strong>CVE List Download Format Changes</strong> &mdash; After JSON 4.0 Retirement, JSON 5.0 format will be the only format available for CVE List downloads. All other download formats will be retired at the same time JSON 4.0 is retired (read [announcement](https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/blog/2022/01/18/CVE-List-Download-Formats-Are)).

## Bulletin Number 2
<strong>*CVE Services Transition  —  February 11, 2022*</strong>

For CVE CNAs, the transition to CVE Services and JSON 5.0 began in December 2019 with the deployment of CVE Services 1.0 (the CVE ID Reservation (IDR) system) and the continued review and evolution the new CVE Record format (i.e., JSON 5.0). In June 2020 CVE Services 1.1 was deployed and in September 2021 CVE Services 2.0 was deployed into the new CVE Testing Instance. In November 2021, the community finalized the new JSON 5.0 format with the release of JSON 5.0 Release Candidate 5. Additional transition activities will take place in the spring of 2022 that will culminate in a major step forward for the automation effort for the program and the adoption of a richer, more robust CVE Record format (i.e., CVE JSON 5.0).

<strong>Spring 2022 CVE Services/JSON 5.0 Transition Activity Overview:</strong>

<ol>
<li><strong>CVE Services 2.1 Community Testing in the Testing Instance</strong> — In late February/early March 2022, the <a href="https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups#AutomationWorkingGroupAWG" target="_blank">CVE Automation Working Group (AWG)</a> is planning on releasing CVE Services 2.1 into the CVE Services Testing Instance. As with CVE Service 2.0 testing, CNAs will be able to continue to test their clients against this instance. CVE Services 2.1 is the target version of CVE Services that will be deployed into production that will be supporting JSON 5.0 for the community.</li>
<li><strong>CVE Services 2.1 Community Penetration Testing</strong> — Upon the release of CVE Service 2.1 into the Testing Instance, the CVE Services 2.1 Community Penetration Testing effort will commence and will run for approximately 3 weeks into mid/late March 2022. The <a href="https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups#AutomationWorkingGroupAWG" target="_blank">AWG</a> will be coordinating this community penetration testing effort so that interested members of the community may perform penetration testing on CVE Services 2.1. (This topic was discussed in the two “CVE Services 2.x Workshops” held September and October 2021). After the completion of the penetration testing effort, there will be a period of time for the development team to respond to issues identified in during the testing.</li>
<li><strong>CNA Community Review of Historical JSON 5.0 Records</strong> — From January through April 2022, the <a href="https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups#AutomationWorkingGroupQWG" target="_blank">CVE Quality Working Group (QWG)</a> will be coordinating two community reviews of historical CVE Records that have been converted to JSON 5.0. During the first review CNAs have an opportunity to review records that they “own” in the new format and offer early feedback on the Secretariat’s upconvert process. During the second review, CNAs will have an opportunity to update the CVE Records they own using the CVE Services Record Submission and Upload Subsystem (RSUS) interface. (This may be preferable for large CNAs who might be interested in upconverting their own records instead of relying on the Secretariat upconvert.) If you or your organization are interested in getting more engaged in the planning of these reviews, please send email to the QWG Co-Chairs.</li>
<li><strong>CVE Services 2.1/JSON 5.0 Soft Deployment</strong> — Once the above activities are completed, there will be a soft deployment of CVE Services 2.1/JSON 5.0 that will span approximately 3 weeks into mid/late April 2022. During this timeframe CVE Services 2.1 will be deployed into the production environment and CNAs will have the full feature set of CVE Services to submit and update JSON 5.0 records. Also, during this time, the QWG will administer the second phase of the CNA Community Review of JSON 5.0 Historical Records (see above), in which CNAs will be encouraged to review the CVE Records they own and make appropriate updates using CVE Services. It is important to note that during the soft deployment phase, only members of the CVE CNA community will have access to the JSON 5.0 CVE List. The general “downstream” user population of the CVE List will continue to observe and download JSON 4.0 Records from the main CVE website.</li>
<li><strong>CVE Services 2.1/JSON 5.0 Hard Deployment</strong> — After the soft deployment phase toward the end of April 2022, the AWG will move into a hard deployment phase that will include deployments to make JSON 5.0-format CVE Records easily accessible to the global community through the deployment of the JSON 5.0 GitHub download capability and the JSON website display and download capability on the main CVE website.</li>
<li><strong>JSON 4.0 Retirement</strong> — Six months after JSON 5.0 is made available to CVE downstream users, JSON 4.0 will be retired. After JSON 4.0 retirement, historical JSON 4.0 records will continue to be available in an archived state. CNAs will be expected to submit CVE Records in JSON 5.0 format through either CVE Services web application API or a program designated web interface. At this time, JSON 5.0 format will be the only format that is available for download (other downloadable formats will be retired).</li>
</ol>
